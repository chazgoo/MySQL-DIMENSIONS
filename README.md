## MySQL-DIMENSIONS

Ultimately, this repository will document the creation of my DIMENSIONS database. The repository containing all of my actual analysis is privately held until publication. Until I have a better idea of what I'm doing, I'll refrain from obsessing over formatting this page - those interested can observe my progress by viewing the [log](https://github.com/chazgoo/MySQL-DIMENSIONS/tree/master/Log).

Update 9/5/19 - Though I've managed to get MySQL (MariaDB, actually) up and running on the server, as well as accessing it via DBeaver (3rd party GUI/manager), it's occurred to me that this isn't all that useful except as an exercise to learn MySQL and maybe make an archive. For now, I'm going to shunt this project aside for a while, and focus on cranking out/releasing the actual analysis.
